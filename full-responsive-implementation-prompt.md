## Part 2: Admin Panel - Full Functionality & Responsiveness

### 2.1 Fix Current Health Status Issue

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Mobile sidebar toggle
const sidebarToggle = document.querySelector('#sidebar-toggle');
const sidebar = document.querySelector('#sidebar');
const overlay = document.querySelector('#sidebar-overlay');

sidebarToggle?.addEventListener('click', () => {
  sidebar.classList.toggle('translate-x-0');
  sidebar.classList.toggle('-translate-x-full');
  overlay.classList.toggle('hidden');
});

overlay?.addEventListener('click', () => {
  sidebar.classList.add('-translate-x-full');
  overlay.classList.add('hidden');
});
```

#### Dashboard Layout

**Desktop:**
- Grid layout (2-3 columns)
- Cards with hover effects

**Implementation for Mobile Tables:**
```html
<!-- Desktop: Table -->
<table class="hidden md:table">...</table>

<!-- Mobile: Cards -->
<div class="md:hidden space-y-4">
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Product Name</h3>
    <p>Description</p>
    <div class="actions">
      <button>Edit</button>
